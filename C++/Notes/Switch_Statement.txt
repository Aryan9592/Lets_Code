The numeric statement must be of type int (short int,int, or long int), char or bool
The case lables must be constants (literals or named constants)
If no case lable matches the value of numeric-expression, control branches to the default lable (if there is no default lable than control passes to the statement following the entire switch statement)
After a branch is taken, control proceeds sequentially until either break or the end of the switch statement occurs. That's why there is usually break at the end of the each statement
