It is a C.B.T (Complete Binary Tree) that comes with a heap order property
    
What is a CBT?
    - Every level is completely filled; last one isn't compulsory to be filled up
    - nodes always added towards the left..

        E.g                     1                                          |                    1
                               / \                                         |                   / \
                              2   3         --> A complete Binary tree     |                  2   3             --> Not a complete binary treee
                             / \  |                                        |                     / \
                            4   5 6                                        |                    4   5

2. Two types of Heap:
    1. Max Heap                                     2. Min Heap
        E.g:            40                                E.g:                          5
                       /  \                                                            / \
                      30  20                                                          10  15
                     /  \                                                            /  \ 
                    10   5                                                          20   30

3. Insertion at Heap:
    In Max Heap:
        (a). Node -> ith index
        (b). left child -> 2*i index
        (c). right child -> 2*i + 1 index
        (d). parent -> i/2 index
    
    Note: -Whenever a new node is added into the heap then first we will add it to the end and then compare it to the parent of that level node
          -If it's value is greater than the parent then both will be swapped and this will continue till the heap is sorted
