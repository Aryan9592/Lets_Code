Wrappers are a convenient way to modify an existing environment without having to alter the underlying code directly. Using wrappers will allow you to avoid a lot of boilerplate code
and make your environment more modular. Wrappers can also be chained to combine their effects. Most environments that are generated via gym.make will already be wrapped by default.

In order to wrap an environment, you must first initialize a base environment. Then you can pass this environment along with (possibly optional) parameters to the wrapperâ€™s constructor:

>>>import gym
>>>from gym.wrappers import RescaleAction
>>>base_env = gym.make("BipedalWalker-v3")
>>>base_env.action_space
Box([-1. -1. -1. -1.], [1. 1. 1. 1.], (4,), float32)
>>>wrapped_env = RescaleAction(base_env, min_action=0, max_action=1)
>>>wrapped_env.action_space
Box([0. 0. 0. 0.], [1. 1. 1. 1.], (4,), float32)
